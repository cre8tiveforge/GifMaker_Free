![](/Gifmaker%20Preview%20-%20Gumroad.png)

### Features:

- Very Small Application Size

- Simple Drag and Drop Interface

- Will use full computer resources available without slowing down the computer

- Saves gifs to a "GIFs" folder in the same location as the app

- Selectable Options based on years of experience and the creation of over 300 gifs

- Selectable Options include FPS, Resolution and Time

- Overwrite toggle for quickly remaking the gif as needed


#### Note:

I can understand concerns about exe files online, so If you'd rather build it out yourself, just make sure you have python and the library requirements installed and run the following command in the terminal from the folder with the script

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed gifmakerv2.py
