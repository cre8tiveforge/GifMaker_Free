* Download the exe, unzip anywhere you want and run it (feel free to run through virus scanner first)
* Requires ffmpeg to be installed
* Get ffmpeg for manual install from the source here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
* or use the quick installer here: https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer
 

#### Note:

I can understand concerns about exe files online, so If you'd rather build it out yourself, just make sure you have python and the library requirements installed and run the following command in the terminal from the folder with the script

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed gifmakerv2.py
